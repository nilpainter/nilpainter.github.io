A painter's pursuit of light and form, documented through layers of pigment and thought.

## The Work

What began as curious experiments with color has evolved into a daily practice—a meditation on light, texture, and the quiet moments between intention and result. Each painting is a conversation between what I see and what refuses to be captured.

## The Studio

My studio sits on the north coast, where the light changes by the hour and the smell of linseed oil mingles with salt air. It's a space of controlled chaos: half-finished canvases lean against the walls, tubes of paint accumulate like sediment, and the floor tells the story of every session.

## Process

I work primarily in oils, building up layers over days and weeks. The underpainting sets the mood—often warm oranges and umbers that glow through subsequent glazes. There's something meditative about watching paint dry, about returning to a canvas with fresh eyes, about the slow accretion of form from chaos.
